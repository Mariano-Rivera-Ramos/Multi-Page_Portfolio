    "title": "Reflection on Using LLM’s",
    "section": "",
    "text": "How LLMs turned a vague brief into a workable site\nThe biggest win in this assignment was using LLMs to move from “I kinf of know what I want to a working, publishable portfolio—fast. I started with my CV, a few constraints (Quarto, multi-page, UCW context), and the rubric. The model gave me a clean site map (Home, Resume, Projects, Skills, Leadership, Contact, Reflection, Appendix) and a working _quarto.yml with a navbar on the first pass. That initial scaffold meant I could spend my energy on the content. In short: LLM for structure and acceleration, me for judgment and verification.\nThe LLM’s ability to adapt to my criteria and the course rubric was a bomb of efficiency. The proposed site map already covered nearly all required elements and even shipped with a working Quarto YAML, so I could move straight from outline to implementation. From there, I used short prompts to turn the scaffold into pages, added acceptance criteria per section, and iterated in quick micro-sprints.\nRapid design\nI used the LLM to produce page skeletons with headings, and callouts. It also created a CSS snipet for a dark style and the large centered photo on the About me page. The important part is no just that it delivered a coherent starting point in seconds, but that it was able to create a functioning template where to put all the needed information. From there, polishing was straightforward: adjust tone, swap the placeholder image with my photo, and wire the Download CV and Open in Colab buttons.\nI asked the LLM for micro-plans and acceptance criteria per track: “What does ‘Resume’ look like when done?” “What’s the checklist for ‘Projects’ with two Colab notebooks and two .docx downloads” The result was a set of short sprints I could finish and test the same day. Example: Projects page, pass 1 (add three cases), pass 2 (Colab buttons + summaries), pass 3 (marketing/operations .docx with download). This kept momentum and reduced the chance of cosmetic tweaks delaying work."
